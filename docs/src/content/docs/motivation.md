Den is basically about a single idea:

> Being able to share re-usable (parametric) cross-class Nix configurations.

Den was born not to be yet-another zillionth way to wire-up configurations.

The purpose of Den is *social* more than purely _technical_.

Den can be used with/without flakes, with/without flake-parts, because it is an
exploration on how to take nix module sharing to a higher-level, literaly, since
*dendritic* modules contain one or more of other classic _non-dendritic_ modules.

## The history of Den

Before creating Den, my `vic/vix` infra was made with flake-parts (previously I had used `blueprint`, `snowfall`, and before that a couple of my own in-flake tailor-made libs) and I was really happy with dendritic flake-parts. 
You can still browse the [`noden`](https://github.com/vic/vix/tree/noden) branch as an example of a flake-parts based Dendritic setup.

So I dreamed about having a place akin to the `Nix User Repository` but for finding Dendritic aspects made by others. That is still an on-going effort named [dendrix](https://dendrix.oeiuwq.com/). At that time there were just a handful of people using Dendritic publicly, and every module even when they followed a dendritic-style were clearly not made with re-usability in mind, user-specifics and host-specifics where always there somehow, or even worse, trying to evaluate a single module demanded to also download all of the owner's particular inputs.

At that time [unify](https://codeberg.org/quasigod/unify) - the first dendritic framework I know of- entered my radar, and I really loved it! It was missing a couple of features that I needed in my existing infra, but I loved the `<aspect>.<class>` transposition that its author invented, and the cleaness of the code at the author's infra was a testament to how good-looking and organized a Dendritic setup could look. I certainly wanted that for mine.

However, before adopting `unify`, I realized that my re-usability problem was not about syntax, not about how things are loaded from filesystem nor how they are wired at the flake level.

> The problem was more about feature composability.

Being an fan of functional programming, the most composable things I know are functions.

## **A dendritic aspect in Den is a function**

```nix
# Just like any nixos module can be a function: 
{ pkgs, ... }: { <nixos-settings> }

# A function returning nixos and darwin configs
{ <context> }: { 
  nixos = { pkgs, ... }: { <nixos-settings> }; 
  darwin = { pkgs, ... }: { <darwin-settings> };
  # any other nix-configuration class
}
```

Like `flake.modules.<class>.<name>` transposed and turned into functions.

The result of that exploration was [flake-aspects](https://github.com/vic/flake-aspects). Which is a dependency free library (usable with/without flakes) that focuses on composability not on wiring/building configurations.


`flake-aspects` allows for aspects to be parametric by using the Nix [`__functor` pattern](/explanation/aspects/#the-__functor-pattern), it also allows aspects to be nested unlike the flat-structure we had in `flake.modules` which caused people to use weird-named modules `flake.modules."host/desktop".nixos` or similar for string-based-semantics. It also allows declaring dependencies between aspects themselves, not using **stringly-typed** references like `.modules = [ "base" "gaming" ]` which was one of the shortcomings early-days unify had.

> Some [people](https://codeberg.org/FrdrCkII/nixconf/src/branch/main/modules/aspects.prt.nix) have found `flake-aspects` enough to implement their own Dendritic setups, or even for mixing with other non-dendritic infra.

## Den builds upon flake-aspects

Den, tries to answer some specific issues regarding NixOS/nix-Darwin configurations:

- How to [define entities](/guides/declare-hosts) on your infra:
  
  `den.hosts.<arch>.<hostName>.users.<userName>`

- How to define common [schemas](/guides/declare-hosts#base-modules) (options) for these entities.

  `den.base.host.options.vpn-group = lib.mkOption`

- How to [include features](/guides/batteries) that affect all entities

  `den.default.includes = [ (den._.unfree ["vscode"]) ]`

- How a `Host` can affect its `User`s configurations, and [viceversa](/guides/bidirectional).

- How to [mixin](/guides/namespaces) aspects from remote sources and enhance locally defined ones.

  `den.namespace "omfnix" [ inputs.remote ]`

- How to provide features to the community using a common namespace.

  `{ omfnix, ... }: { omfnix.niri.nixos = ...; }`


## Den is about sharing functions to configs.

Based on Den sharable aspects (which depend on a minimal surface syntax for namespaces), I'm planning to create [denful](https://github.com/vic/denful). A lazyvim-like configurations distribution that people can include from, just like they do with editor distributions.

And this exploration is all part of the `dendrix` initiative. Trying to come up with better ways to share configurations *even* between flakes/no-flakes users. `dendrix` indexes using [`import-tree`](https://github.com/vic/import-tree) collections instead of flakes, because flakes demand all its inputs to be downloaded, a collection of modules in an import-tree can define the inputs they need by using [`flake-file`](https://github.com/vic/flake-file) and these inputs can be propagated to the final user's flake or npins/unflake.

So, `dendrix` became something like an index of browsable aspects found in GitHub, my intention was that showing the different aspects each people produces would motivate re-usability, because a major problem I see in the Nix community is most people just copy and paste and/or re-invent the wheel in so many infinite ways. 

Den is more about giving to others (creating useful Nix software/configurations), not just about make things work locally.
