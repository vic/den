User TODO: REMOVE this directory (or disable its import from den.nix).
Move any module you find useful from here into your /modules directory.

This directory contains a bare-bones layout for using den.
It is inspired on the patterns shown in the
dendritic implementation at [vic/vix](https://github.com/vic/vix/tree/den).

Use it as reference of how to organize things.

Feel free to adapt the layout, explore by yourself
and find out how things work for you. Be sure to share your insights with
the [community](https://github.com/vic/den/discussions)
