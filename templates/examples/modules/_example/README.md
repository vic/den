User TODO: REMOVE this directory (or disable its import from den.nix)

It is used to implement tests for all den feature so we can validate at CI.

Use it as reference to see how den features are used,
however, be aware that this might not be the best practices for file/aspect
organization.

For a more "real-world" layout, see the `_profile` directory
which is somewhat inspired on the
dendritic implementation at [vic/vix](https://github.com/vic/vix/tree/8c8c7b8).

However, feel free to also not use any predefined layout, explore by yourself
and find out how things work for you. Be sure to share your insights with
the [community](https://github.com/vic/den/discussions)
